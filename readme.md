## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.25 or later
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend development)
- Valid TLS certificates (or use self-signed for development)

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EslamYasser-Dev/simple-file-share.git
   cd simple-file-share/backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   export FILE_SHARE_ROOT=/path/to/storage
   export FILE_SHARE_USERNAME=admin
   export FILE_SHARE_PASSWORD=securepassword
   export JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
   export TLS_CERT_FILE=path/to/cert.pem
   export TLS_KEY_FILE=path/to/key.pem
   ```

4. **Run the server**
   ```bash
   go run cmd/server/main.go
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to frontend directory**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Docker Setup

1. **Build and run with Docker Compose**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- Always use strong passwords and JWT secrets
- Keep TLS certificates up to date
- Regularly audit file permissions
- Monitor access logs for suspicious activity
- Consider adding rate limiting in production
- Validate all user inputs
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration

## 🔁 CI/CD

This repository uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery.

- **CI Workflow**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - Builds and tests the backend (Go) on push/PR to `master`/`main`
  - Builds the frontend (Vite/React) to ensure it compiles
  - Publishes the frontend `dist/` as a build artifact

- **Release Workflow**: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
  - Triggers on tags that match `v*.*.*` (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
  - Builds a static Linux-amd64 backend binary at `build/file-share-server`
  - Builds the frontend and packages it as `build/frontend-dist.tar.gz`
  - Creates a GitHub Release and uploads both artifacts automatically

### How to cut a release

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```
