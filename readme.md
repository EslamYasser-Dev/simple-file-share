![Release](https://github.com/EslamYasser-Dev/simple-file-share/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)

## 🌟 Overview

The Go File Share API is a high-performance, secure file management system built with Go. It provides a robust, scalable solution for handling file operations over HTTPS with a clean, intuitive API. Built with clean architecture principles, it offers a flexible foundation that can be extended with different storage backends.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 🛡️ Security First
- **End-to-End HTTPS**: All communications are encrypted using TLS 1.3
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Built-in safeguards against directory traversal attacks
- **Basic Authentication**: Secure access control with username/password protection
- **CORS Protection**: Configurable CORS policies for web security

### 🚀 Performance Optimized
- **Efficient File Handling**: Stream-based processing for minimal memory usage
- **Concurrent Operations**: Handles multiple file operations efficiently
- **ZIP Streaming**: On-the-fly ZIP creation for folder downloads without temporary files

### 📁 Advanced File Operations
- **Directory Browsing**: Clean HTML interface with file details
- **Bulk Operations**: Upload/download multiple files or entire folders
- **On-Demand Zipping**: Download folders as ZIP archives with a single click
- **File Metadata**: View file sizes, modification dates, and types

### 🏗️ Clean Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Separated domain, application, and infrastructure layers
- **Dependency Injection**: Easy to test and maintain
- **Pluggable Storage**: Built with interfaces for easy storage backend swapping
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Built-in structured logging for monitoring and debugging

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Language**: Go 1.21+
- **Web Framework**: Standard Library `net/http`
- **Authentication**: HTTP Basic Auth
- **TLS**: Built-in support with automatic certificate management
- **Testing**: Native Go testing with table-driven tests
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI 3.0 (Swagger) specification

### Endpoints

#### 1. List Directory or Download File
```
GET /
```
- **Parameters**:
  - `path` (query, optional): Directory path to list or file to download
- **Responses**:
  - `200`: Directory listing (HTML) or file download
  - `401`: Authentication required
  - `403`: Forbidden (path traversal detected)
  - `404`: Path not found

#### 2. Upload Files/Folders
```
POST /upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```
- **Parameters**:
  - `file` (form-data): File(s) to upload
  - `path` (form-data, optional): Target directory
- **Responses**:
  - `200`: Upload successful (HTML response)
  - `400`: Invalid request
  - `401`: Authentication required
  - `403`: Forbidden
  - `413`: Payload too large

#### 3. Health Check
```
GET /health
```
- **Responses**:
  - `200`: Service is healthy
  ```json
  {
    "status": "healthy"
  }
  ```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or later
- Valid TLS certificates (or use self-signed for development)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-file-share.git
   cd go-file-share/backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

3. Configure environment variables
   ```bash
   export FILE_SHARE_ROOT=/path/to/storage
   export FILE_SHARE_USERNAME=admin
   export FILE_SHARE_PASSWORD=securepassword
   export TLS_CERT_FILE=path/to/cert.pem
   export TLS_KEY_FILE=path/to/key.pem
   ```

4. Run the server
   ```bash
   go run cmd/server/main.go
   ```

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- Always use strong passwords
- Keep TLS certificates up to date
- Regularly audit file permissions
- Monitor access logs for suspicious activity
- Consider adding rate limiting in production

## 🔁 CI/CD

This repository uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery.

- **CI Workflow**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - Builds and tests the backend (Go) on push/PR to `master`/`main`.
  - Builds the frontend (Vite/React) to ensure it compiles.
  - Publishes the frontend `dist/` as a build artifact.

- **Release Workflow**: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
  - Triggers on tags that match `v*.*.*` (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
  - Builds a static Linux-amd64 backend binary at `build/file-share-server`.
  - Builds the frontend and packages it as `build/frontend-dist.tar.gz`.
  - Creates a GitHub Release and uploads both artifacts automatically using `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

### How to cut a release

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The Release workflow will build artifacts and publish a release on GitHub.
